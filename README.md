## Problem Statement

We decided to solve this problem because current financial advisories lack personalization and transparency, often providing generic recommendations that fail to meet individual needs. Users typically have no control over which parts of their data are used, and their specific considerations are often overlooked. This results in a significant trust deficit, as many feel that the advice is not well-curated or in their best interest. Addressing these issues is crucial to improving user satisfaction and confidence in financial services.

GenAI can deliver highly personalized and transparent financial advisories by analyzing vast amounts of data to tailor advice to each user's unique situation and preferences. Moreover, GenAI's ability to provide clear explanations for its recommendations fosters greater trust and confidence among users. The integration of explainability with GenAI is particularly exciting, as it ensures users understand how and why specific advice is given, further enhancing trust and engagement.
